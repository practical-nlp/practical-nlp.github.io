                     <p class="mb-3 f-15 ">Practical NLP focuses squarely on an overlooked demographic: the practitioners and business leaders in industry! While many great books focus on ML’s algorithmic fundamentals, this book exposes the anatomy of real-world systems: from e-commerce applications to virtual assistants. Painting a realistic picture of modern production systems, the book teaches not only deep learning, but also the heuristics and patchwork pipelines that define the (actual) state of the art for deployed NLP systems. The authors zoom out, teaching problem formulation, and aren’t afraid to zoom in on the grimy details, including handling messy data and sustaining live systems. This book will prove invaluable to industry professionals keen to build and deploy NLP in the wild.

This book offers the best of both worlds: it is thorough yet accessible. It provides the reader with a solid foundation in natural-language processing,if you would like to go from zero to one in NLP, this book is for you!

I am happy to see this book on “Practical NLP”, which fills this much needed gap. The authors have meticulously, thoughtfully and lucidly covered each and every aspect of NLP that one has to be aware of while building large scale practical systems; at the same time, this book has also managed to cover a large number of examples and varied application areas and verticals. This book is a must for all aspiring NLP engineers, entrepreneurs who want to build companies around language technologies, and also academic researchers who would like to see their inventions reach the real users.

                     <p class="mb-3 f-15">Practical NLP focuses on how to properly build NLP systems for the real world. Before this book, anyone taking an NLP model past the prototype stage for the first time had to rely on trial and error and a patchwork of blog posts from around the Internet. This book gives a consolidated look at modern practice, starting from an MVP and building up to examples for sophisticated use cases.

                     <p class="mb-3 f-15 ">The field of Natural Language Processing has undergone a dramatic shift in recent years, both in terms of methodology and in terms of the applications supported. Methodological advances have ranged from new ways of representing documents to new techniques for language synthesis. With these have come new applications ranging from open-ended conversational systems to techniques that use natural language for model interpretability. Finally, these advances have seen natural language processing gain a foothold in related areas, such as computer vision and recommender systems, some of which my lab is working on with support from Amazon, Samsung and the National Science Foundation.
                     </p>
                     <p class="mb-3 f-15 ">As NLP is expanding into these exciting new areas, so too has the audience of practitioners wanting to make use of NLP techniques. In the Data Science course (CSE 258) I take at UCSD which is often the most attended in the computer science department, I see more and more students are doing their projects on NLP based topics. Rapidly, NLP is becoming a necessary skill required by engineers and product managers, to scientists, students, and enthusiasts wishing to build applications on top of natural language data. On one hand, new tools and libraries for NLP and machine learning have made natural language modeling more accessible than ever. But on the other hand, resources for learning NLP must target this ever-growing and diverse audience. This is especially true for organizations that have recently adopted NLP, or for students working with natural language data for the first time.
                     </p>
                     <p class="mb-3 f-15 ">It has been my pleasure over the last few years to collaborate with Bodhisattwa Majumder on exciting new applications in natural language processing and dialog, so I was thrilled to hear about his efforts, along with Sowmya Vajjala, Anuj Gupta, Harshit Surana, to write a book on NLP. They have a wide experience in scaling NLP including at early-stage startups, the MIT Media Lab, Microsoft Research, and Google AI.
                     </p>
                     <p class="mb-3 f-15 ">I am excited by the end-to-end approach taken in their book, which will make it useful for a range of scenarios, and will help readers to work with the labyrinth of possible options while building NLP applications. I am especially thrilled by the focus on modern NLP applications such as chatbots, as well as the focus on interdisciplinary topics such as e-commerce and retail. These topics will be especially useful for industry leaders and researchers, and critically are topics that have been given limited coverage in existing textbooks. This book will be ideal both as a first resource to discover the field of natural language processing, as well as for seasoned practitioners looking to discover the latest developments in this exciting area.
